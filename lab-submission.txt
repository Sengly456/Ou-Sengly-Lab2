Lab Submission: Docker Containerization and Application Management

Part 1: Containerizing an Application

-Learned how to build a Docker image from my application code.

-Learned how to run a container from the image.

-Learned how to publish container ports to access the application in a browser.

Part 2: Updating the Application

-Learned how to update an application by building a new image after modifying the code.

-Learned that I need to stop the old container before running a new version.

-Learned how to remove containers to manage old versions.

Part 3: Sharing an Application

-Learned how to share a Docker image using Docker Hub.

-Learned how to tag images to rename or version them for easier sharing.

Part 4: Persisting Data with Volumes

-Learned how to create and use Docker volumes to persist data.

-Understood that volumes allow container data to survive even if the container is stopped or deleted.

Part 5: Using Bind Mounts

-Learned how to bind mount a host directory to a container.

-Changes made on the host or inside the container are immediately reflected on both sides, enabling faster development and testing.

Part 6: Multi-Container Applications

-Learned how to connect multiple containers using Docker networks.

-Understood that containers on the same network can communicate with each other.

Part 7: Using Docker Compose

-Learned how to define and manage multi-container setups using docker-compose.yml.

-Learned that docker compose up -d builds and runs all containers in one command, simplifying workflows.

Part 8: Image Building Best Practices

-Learned that not all project files (dependencies, source code) need to be in the final container.

-Only the necessary static build files should be included to improve performance and reduce image size.
